abstract: "
We propose developing an integrated system to keep autonomous unmanned aircraft safely separated and 
behave as expected in conjunction with manned traffic. The main goal is to achieve safe manned-unmanned 
vehicle teaming to improve system performance, have each (robot/human) teammate learn from each other 
in various aircraft operations, and reduce the manning needs of manned aircraft. The proposed system
anticipates and reacts to other aircraft using natural language instructions and can serve as a 
co-pilot or operate entirely autonomously. We point out the main technical challenges where 
improvements on current state-of-the-art are needed to enable Visual Flight Rules to fully autonomous 
aerial operations, bringing insights to these critical areas. Furthermore, we present an interactive 
demonstration in a prototypical scenario with one AI pilot and one human pilot sharing the same 
terminal airspace, interacting with each other using language, and landing safely on the same runway. 
We also show a demonstration of a vision-only aircraft detection system.
