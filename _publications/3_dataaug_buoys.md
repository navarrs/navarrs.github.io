abstract: "
Deep learning-based frameworks have been widely used in object recognition, perception and autonomous 
navigation tasks, showing outstanding feature extraction capabilities. Nevertheless, the effectiveness 
of such detectors usually depends on large amounts of training data. For specific object-recognition 
tasks, it is often difficult and time-consuming to gather enough valuable data. Data Augmentation has 
been broadly adopted to overcome these difficulties, as it allows to increase the training data and 
introduce variation in qualitative elements like color, illumination, distortion and orientation. In 
this paper, we leverage on the object detection framework YOLOv2 to evaluate the behavior of an 
obstacle detection system for an autonomous boat designed for the International RoboBoat Competition. 
We are focused on how the overall performance of a model changes with different augmentation 
techniques. Thus, we analyze the features that the network learns by using geometric and pixel-wise 
transformations to augment our data. Our instances of interest are buoys and sea markers, thus to 
generate training data comprising these classes, we simulated the aquatic surface of the boat and 
collected data from the COCO dataset. Finally, we discuss that significant generalization is achieved 
in the learning process of our experiments using different augmentation techniques.
