abstract: "
This paper proposes an approach to segment point clouds with high levels of vertical 
sparsity, which are typically generated by low-end LiDARs, like the Velodyne VLP-16. Special 
consideration is given–but not limited–to the identification of ground points. The approach addresses 
two important issues: the fact that the sparsity of points makes it hard to infer an object’s 
structure, and the difficulty of obtaining and annotating data for testing and training. The first 
issue is tackled by using a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Recurrent CRF for 
point-wise class prediction. To address the second issue, which arises from the need to train this 
network, the proposed approach extracts sparse examples from dense point clouds available in public
datasets. The approach was tested using down-sampled data from the KITTI dataset, which contains 
annotated examples of the object instances car, pedestrian and cyclist. However, since the ground 
class is often missing from annotated datasets, and given its significance in this work, a ground 
annotation algorithm was developed and used to automatically label the sparse data and add it to the 
other labeled classes available from the dataset. The sparse data obtained was used to train and test
the CNN to characterize its prediction accuracy. Additionally, the network was tested using data 
collected with a low-end sensor. The experiments show that the system achieves accurate predictions 
in real time that are comparable to those reported from denser point clouds.
