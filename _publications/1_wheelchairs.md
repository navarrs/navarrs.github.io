abstract: "
Wheelchairs are one of the most important auxiliary instruments for people with mobility 
impairments. Accurate detection and tracking of these devices could bring a number of improvements 
in automated services that aim to assist, monitor and provide better accessibility to allow wheelchair 
users to participate in community life. In this paper, we present a Deep Learning-based wheelchair 
detection and tracking system to address some of the limitations of previous approaches, which
include detecting different types of wheelchairs in cluttered environments and from different viewing 
angles. We explore region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (R-CNN), in particular Faster R-CNN, 
as it has become one of the top performers for object detection tasks. We evaluate the performance of 
different training techniques using two Faster R-CNN frameworks and different backbone network 
structures. Furthermore, we present how we empirically addressed some of the preceding limitations by
applying specific data augmentation techniques and constraints to our model. We demonstrate that using a region-
based implementation outperforms previous approaches in terms of overall robustness, accuracy and 
flexibility.
