# Abstract

The fast-growing demand for fully autonomous aerial operations in shared spaces necessitates developing
trustworthy agents that can safely and seamlessly navigate in crowded, dynamic spaces. In this work, 
we propose **Social Robot Tree Search (SoRTS)**, an algorithm for the safe navigation of mobile robots in 
social domains. SoRTS aims to augment existing socially-aware trajectory prediction policies with a
Monte Carlo Tree Search planner for improved downstream navigation of mobile robots. To evaluate the 
performance of our method, we choose the use case of social navigation for general aviation. To aid 
this evaluation, within this work, we also introduce **X-PlaneROS**, a high-fidelity aerial simulator,
to enable more research in full-scale aerial autonomy. By conducting a user study based on the assessments 
of **26 FAA-certified pilots**, we show that SoRTS performs comparably to a competent human pilot, 
significantly outperforming our baseline algorithm. We further complement these results with
self-play experiments, showcasing our algorithm’s behavior in scenarios with increasing complexity.

# Method

We present **Social Robot Tree Search (SoRTS)**, an algorithm for safe navigation of mobile robots in 
social settings. SoRTS aims to augment existing data-driven socially-aware motion prediction models 
with a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner, enabling long-horizon social navigation. Although the 
algorithm is designed to be domain-independent, in our work we use general aviation in non-towered 
airports as our case of study.

</p>


SoRTS' tree search is biased by **social** and a **reference** modules. The **social** module aims to 
handle *short-horizon agent-to-agent dynamics*. It does so by leveraging socially-aware motion 
prediction model which was trained offline on trajectory data.

<p align="center">
  <img width="1280" src="/assets//posts/2024-03-21-sorts/social_module.png" alt="SoRTS">
</p>

The **reference** module provides a global path to the agent which embodies a navigation 
guideline *(e.g., an FAA-established flying pattern)* that the agent should stick to whenever there 
aren't any *social conflicts* to resolve. This module also provides a cost map that represents a
frequence count map to encourage the agent to visit most-frequent regions.

</p>

Finally, SoRTS's combines the decision modalities of these two modules via **Monte Carlo Tree Search 
(MCTS)** to achieve long-horizon navigation by backpropagating most successful outcomes. The figure 
below shows a *toy-example* of two aircraft merging on a single path, where each can execute three 
possible motion primitives <sup>1</sup>: forward, speed up, and slow down. MCTS, in its forward simulations, 
not only prunes branches that lead to future collisions but also uses the social module to choose between 
cutting-in-front (socially undesirable) and yielding (socially desirable), thereby producing socially 
compliant and safe behavior.

# Results

We support our method with two evaluation settings: a user study and self-play experiments. 

### User-Study 

We designed a **within-subject** study with 26 participants, all of which were FAA-certified. 
Using our flight simulator, [**XPlaneROS**](https://theairlab.org/xplane_ros/), we asked users to 
land an aircraft at a specified runway while interacting with a second pilot instructed to complete
the same task. The task required both pilots to coordinate with each other, i.e., being 
socially-compliant and follow FAA flying patterns. As shown in the figure below, the second pilot
was either a human, SoRTS or a baseline<sup>2</sup> algorithm. In each trial, the algorithm<sup>3</sup> 
order was randomly chosen.

<p align="center">
  <img width="1280" src="/assets//posts/2024-03-21-sorts/user_study.gif" alt="SoRTS">
</p>

The study aimed at analyzing the second pilot's **navigational performance** (e.g, ability to follow
rules, navigate smoothly, etc) and **safety** (e.g, comfort, collision risk, etc) by analyzing how 
the users perceived the other pilot, but also by studying the trajectory information from each trial.

Overall, we found that users rated SoRTS’ and the human’s competence similarly, while the baseline was 
perceived as less competent. The figure below shows examples of two experiments. **Left:** Each row shows the 
resulting trajectories of a user interacting with our human pilot, SoRTS, and the baseline. 
The top row shows a user that successfully followed the expected guideline; we can see that the 
baseline did not fly as smoothly as SoRTS, and abruptly cut short close to the goal. The 
bottom row shows a user that did not follow the expected guideline; our algorithm still 
managed to navigate properly, whereas the baseline behaved erratically, unsafely crossing 
over the runway. **Right:** Box-plots showing the *per-algorithm* distribution 
of the results from the user study: the top ones show the average scores given by the user 
for navigation performance (a) and safety (b). The bottom ones show the average reference error 
(a) and loss-of-separation (b) metrics obtained from the trajectory data.

### Self-Play Experiments

#### Baseline vs. SoRTS

We also performed self-play experiments to further examine the behavior of our algorithm and its 
baseline. These experiments follow the same design as our user study but we also analyze experiments 
with 3 and 4 agents in each scenario. The figure below shows animated examples from our simulations. 
We also provide quantitative evaluations, performed on the resulting trajectories.

#### SoRTS conflict resolution

Here's a simulation example showing each agent's reference trajectories (transparent blue) and executed trajectories (blue), as well as their long-horizon rollouts (pink). In this example, we can see how 
the agent on the left preemptively avoids a social conflict, allowing the other agent to pass and land
first. Once the <i>social conflict</i> is resolved, the agent resumes its task.

#### Footnotes 

1. In our method, we actually leverage a set of 252 motion primitives. 
2. The baseline algorithm uses the same **social** and **reference** components but combines them
naively by weighting them together. 
3. We use second pilot and algorithm interchangeably.
